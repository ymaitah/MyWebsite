# EECS 183

Course title: Elementary Programming Concepts  
Instructor: William Patrick Arthur  
Rating: 10/10

## Personal Reflections
I was still undecided on what major to choose as a freshman, so I came into this class with no programming experience and an open mind. To keep things short, this class was nothing short of spectacular. Professor Arthur was amazing, explaining content clearly yet thoroughly and answering questions in a way that uplifted students. Combined with Professor Arthur's great teaching, the course content was fun and fulfilling. Projects in this class never felt overwhelming, and combined with the online homework, you learn a lot. This is a higher workload class, but it never felt like I was doing busy work.

This is a fun and satisfying course that introduces you to the world of computer science and engineering as a whole. I would highly recommend this course for anyone who can take it.
