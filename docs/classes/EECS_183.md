Course title: Elementary Programming Concepts  
Instructor: William Patrick Arthur  
Rating: 10/10

## Personal Reflections
If you're reading this you probably didn't know that I actually wasn't originally going to be an engineer; I was in the Literature, Science, and the Arts School my first year. That's right, my first year I was in LSA doing pre-medicine. Boy am I happy that I made the switch to engineering, and this class played a large part in that.

I was still sort of undecided what direction I wanted to go with in my academic career, and so I came into this class with no programming experience and an open mind. To keep things short, this class was nothing short of spectacular. Professor Arthur was amazing, explaining content clearly yet thorougly and answering questions in a way that uplifted students. Combined with Professor Arthur's great teaching, the course content was fun and fulfilling. Projects in this class never felt overwhelming, and combined with the online homeworks, you learn a lot. This is a higher workload class, but it never felt like I was doing busy work. Instead, it was getting more practice and familiarity with this magical language called C++ (and a touch of Python).

This is a fun and satisfying course that introduces you into the world of computer science and engineering as a whole. I would highly recommend this course for anyone who can take it: it may change your life

(P.S. if anyone on the 183 staff is reading this I would *love* to IA for this course)
